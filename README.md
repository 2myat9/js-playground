# js-playground
*my playground for experimenting with vanilla JS*

The setup is simple-- the links to pages are on the main page (index.html) and each page is a place for testing a single JS script.
In most cases, each page has 1 HTML, 1 CSS, and 1 JS file.

This is a pure frontend environment.
Parcel is used to bundle this project.
